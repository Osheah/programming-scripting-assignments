## Week 1 exercise 
Exercise 1 for week 1 in programming and scripting for hdip data analytics gmit
This exercise is in folder week1/fibname.py [link](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/python-fib/blob/master/fib.py) links to an example program that calculated the 30th Fibonacci number. Question is to change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. e.g. My first name is Helen, so I should calculate the 22nd Fibonacci number because H is 8 and n is 14, giving 22 in total. 
## Week 2 exercise
This exercise is in folder week 2/fibname.py [link](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/python-fib/blob/master/fibname.py) links to a program Ian McLoughlin wrote. The question is to copy and run the program  but change the string variable to contain your own surname (Helen O'Shea), and rerun it. Additionally figure out what ord() does? Post the output of the program, along with any insight you have as to what ord() does, to the discussions forum and comment it in the fibname code
Comments posted to the discussion form are comments in the code
## Week 3 exercise  
This exercise is in folder week3/collatz.py
Exercies and projects for data analytics course programming and scripting 
This programme is to answer the following exercise 3. It takes a positive integer and if even, doubles it but if odd multiplies it by 3 and adds one (e.g. f(n) = {2n if n even, 3n+1 if n odd}. The inital value for the programme can be entered by prompt.
### Exercise 3 question
Please complete the following exercise this week. In the video lectures we discussed the Collatz conjecture. Complete the exercise discussed in the Collatz conjecture video by writing a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code. Add the script to your GitHub repository, as per the instruction in the Assessments section.
## Week 4 no assignments
## Week 5 exercise
### exercise 4
This exercise is in folder week5/eulerprob5.py
write a programme in python to find solution to Euler Problem 5 Smallest Multiple fo factorial 20
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
